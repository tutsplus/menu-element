### Tuts+ Tutorial: Introducing the HTML5 “Menu” and “Menuitem” Elements
#### Instructor: Thoriq Firdus

Today I’m going to introduce you to two HTML5 elements: &lt;menu> and &lt;menuitem>, part of the Interactive Elements specification. The web has evolved into something more than just linked documents; pages behave increasingly these days like apps. As such, it’s an appropriate time to form standard web interactivity features.

These two elements are amongst the least talked-about among developers, probably owing to their lack of support in major browsers. Firefox is the sole browser to have implemented this element at the time of writing.
